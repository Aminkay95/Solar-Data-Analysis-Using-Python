# Solar Electricity Analysis and Battery Storage Optimization

This project analyzes solar electricity generation, electricity usage, and battery usage data to evaluate the economic and energy benefits of integrating a battery system into a solar power setup. By leveraging Python and its libraries, the project provides insights into energy efficiency, cost savings, and overall system optimization.

Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to determine the potential benefits of installing a battery to store excess solar electricity. Specifically, the analysis focuses on:

Visualizing solar electricity generation and electricity usage patterns.
Quantifying the electricity bought from the grid without and with a battery.
Modeling the battery charge level and its impact on cost savings.
Aggregating data for monthly trends and visualizations.
While the analysis reveals potential annual savings of $352, it concludes that, at the current system capacity, the cost of installing a $4,000 battery is not economically justified.

Features and Steps
Step 1: Data Visualization and Checks
Goal: Load and explore data from an Excel file.
Tools Used: pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for visualizing daily average solar electricity generation and usage patterns.
Step 2: Calculating Electricity Bought (Without Battery)
Goal: Compute the amount of electricity required from the grid by subtracting solar generation from usage.
Tools Used: numpy for efficient element-wise calculations.
Step 3: Calculating Excess Solar Generation
Goal: Determine surplus solar electricity by subtracting usage from generation.
Tools Used: numpy for computation and capping negative values.
Step 4: Modeling Battery Charge Level
Goal: Simulate the batteryâ€™s charge level over time, considering a maximum capacity of 12.5 kWh.
Implementation: Iterative loop updates battery charge based on available excess solar electricity.
Step 5: Calculating Electricity Bought with Battery
Goal: Recompute electricity bought from the grid, accounting for electricity stored in the battery.
Step 6: Calculating Savings from Installing a Battery
Goal: Evaluate the cost savings by comparing electricity expenses with and without a battery.
Assumptions: Electricity price = $0.17/kWh.
Step 7: Data Aggregation and Visualization
Goal: Aggregate data on a monthly basis and visualize trends using bar plots.
Tools Used: matplotlib for monthly visualizations.
